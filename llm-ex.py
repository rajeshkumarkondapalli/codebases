# To run a small local language model (LLM) using Python, you can use the Hugging Face Transformers library. Here’s an example using the distilbert-base-uncased model, a smaller and faster variant of BERT.

# Step-by-Step Guide
# Install Required Libraries:
# Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

!pip install transformers torch

# Load and Use the Model:
# Use the transformers library to load the model and tokenizer, and then generate predictions.
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")

# Example input
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy [MASK]."

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get the predicted token ID
predictions = outputs.logits
masked_index = torch.where(inputs["input_ids"] == tokenizer.mask_token_id)[1]
predicted_token_id = predictions[0, masked_index].argmax(dim=-1).item()

# Decode the predicted token
predicted_token = tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)

print(f"Predicted word: {predicted_token}")


# Install Required Libraries:
# The transformers library by Hugging Face provides the tools to work with pre-trained models, and torch is the backend library used by many models for computations.

# Load and Use the Model:

# Loading the Tokenizer and Model:
# The AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForMaskedLM classes are used to load the tokenizer and model, respectively. We use distilbert-base-uncased for this example.

# Tokenize Input:
# The input text is tokenized into a format that the model can understand.

# Generate Predictions:
# The model generates predictions for the masked token.

# Get the Predicted Token ID:
# The logits (raw predictions) are obtained, and the position of the masked token is found. The predicted token ID is the one with the highest probability.

# Decode the Predicted Token:
# The predicted token ID is converted back to a human-readable token using the tokenizer’s decode method.

# Running the Code
# You can run the provided Python code in your local environment. Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries and have a stable internet connection for downloading the pre-trained model and tokenizer.

# This example demonstrates a simple masked language modeling task. You can adapt it for other tasks like text generation, sequence classification, etc., by using the appropriate model class from the transformers library.

#------
# from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

# # Download and cache the tokenizer and model
# tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
# model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")

# print("Model and tokenizer downloaded and cached successfully.")

# #------
# from transformers import cached_path

# # Print the cache directory
# print(cached_path("."))

# tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", cache_dir="./my_model_cache")
# model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", cache_dir="./my_model_cache")
